_CRISP-DM stands for **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining**.
It is an **open standard process model** that describes common approaches used by data mining and [[Machine Learning]] experts._
![[Pasted image 20230623144257.png]]
CRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into **six major phases**
# 1. Business understanding
_What the business needs._
**Determine:**
- Business Objectives 
- Background Business Objectives 
- Business Success Criteria 
**Assess Situation:**
- Inventory of Resources 
- Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints 
- Risks and Contingencies 
- Terminology 
- Costs and Benefits 
**Determine Goals:**
- Data Mining Goals 
- Data Mining Success Criteria 
- Produce Plan 
- Project Plan 
- Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques
# 2. Data understanding
- which data are available
- at which cost
- collect data
- describe
- explore
- verify data quality
# 3. Data preparation
Analysis techniques:
- converting to tabular format
- converting between data types
Transformations (that can improve results quality):
- normalization
- scaling
- dealing with missing data
- cleaning wrong data
Tasks:
- dataset preparation
- data selection
- data cleaning report
- integrate data
- reformatting data
# 4. Modeling
- Select modeling technique
- Generate test design 
	- split data in test and train
	- choose metrics for evaluation
- Build model
	- parameter setting
	- model description
- assess model
# 5. Evaluation
- rigorous assessment of data mining process
- compare choices o qualitative and quantitative bias
- evaluate confidence of models
- estimate expected impact on the business
- Review of process
# 6. Deployment
_Where the models are used in software systems to obtain some return of investments_
- plan deployment
- plan monitoring and maintenance
- produce final report and presentation
- review project (documentation)
