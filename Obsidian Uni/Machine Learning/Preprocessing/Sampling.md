_Get random samples of the entire dataset._
For both preliminary and final data analysis:
Processing the whole dataset could be too expensive, if a representative subset can be found, good results can be reached anyway.

### Types of sampling

A trade off has to be found between data reduction and precision (less data = less precision).
sampling with or without replacement are almost equivalent if sample size is much smaller than dataset size, but sampling with replacement is much easier to implement (and statistically interpreted).
