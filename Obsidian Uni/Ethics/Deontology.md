Opposed to [[Consequentialism]], Deontologists hold that certain actions are good or bad regardless of their consequencess.
Right has priority over the good: what makes a choice right is its conformity with a moral norm which order or permits it, rather than its good of bad effect.

## Immanuel Kant and universalism
“Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”
maxim= subjective principle of action
universalizability= Imagine a world in which everyone supports and acts on your maxim. Then ask: Can the goal of my action be achieved in such a world?

- Hypotetical imperative -> require to do what fits our goals
- Categorical imperative -> moral imperative that applies to everyone, irrespective to desires

## Dignity
Rational beings capable of morality have an intrinsic worth: dignity, valuable above all price. 
AI should respect human dignity

## Rationality
If you follow rationality you must also be moral:
 1. If you are rational, then you are consistent. 
 2. If you are consistent, then you obey the principle of universalizability (you follow the rules that you would like everybody to follow) 
 3. If you obey the principle of universalizability, then you act morally. 
 4. Therefore, if you are rational, then you act morally. 
 5. Therefore, if you act immorally, then you are irrational.
