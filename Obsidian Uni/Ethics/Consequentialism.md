An action is morally required 
• iff it delivers that best outcome, relative to its alternative 
• Iff its good outcomes outweigh its negative outcomes to the largest extent 
• Iff it produces the highest utility

so an action is moral depending only on the effects (machiavellico -> end justifies the means )
## Utilitarism
Morality as an optimization problem (maximize utility)
utility=happyness/satisfaction
egalitarian, should maximize utility for everybody
