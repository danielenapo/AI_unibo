==immune cells== 20%, Become _phagocites_ during injury and start eating what shouldnt be there

## Macroglia
80% of the human brain, surround neurons with ==**Myelin**==
    -   _Oligodendrocyte_ (central) and _Schwann Cells_ (peripheral): provide insulating material in axons → Myelin sheets
    -   _Astrocytes_: ==Nourish neurons== and regulate concentration of ions and neurotransmitters.
