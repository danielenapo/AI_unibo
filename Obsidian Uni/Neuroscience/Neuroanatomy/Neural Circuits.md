_Groups of interconnected [[Neurons]] that process specific kinds of information_.
Every neuron's behavioural function is determined by its connections.
They don't connect randomly!

## Divergence and Convergence
- **Divergence**: the stretch of one muscle activates many hundreds of neurons  -> INPUT
- **Convergence**: A single motor cell reciever up to 500 inputs from hundreds of sensory cells -> OUTPUT

## Excitatory and Inhibitory
Neurons can be both excitatory (postsynaptic firing) or inhibitory (avoid postsynaptic firing).
This is essential to limbs that have protagonist and antagonist muscles: when one is excited, the other must be inhibited (e.g. in the arm, biceps and triceps are antagonists).
Neural circuits with feedback loops help to ensure this relationship (image A)

# Neural Plasticity
Neural connections can be modified through experience and learning (expecially chemical synapses are more able to change since they don't need to be in direct touch).
- **Short term** changes lasts seconds/hours -> increase or decrease effectiveness of existing established connections
- **Long term** changes are structural changes lasting days.

# Information Transfer
Depending on the type of [[Neurons#Synapses]], the type of communication is different:
- **ELECTRICAL** -> pre and post synapses must phisically touch. The two neurons are **isopotential** -> electrical changes are istantaneously reflected between the two neurons.

- **CHEMICAL** -> presence of synapric cleft (gap) between pre and post synapses.
	- Neurotransmitters are chemical substances
	- Presynaptic terminal: contains vesicles
	- Synaptic vesicles: are filled with molecules of neurotransmitters (released during [[Action Potential]]s).
	It's slower but much more plastic, and can modulate signals.
