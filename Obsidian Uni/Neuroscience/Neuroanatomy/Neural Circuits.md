_Groups of interconnected [[Neurons]] that process specific kinds of information_.
Every neuron's behavioural function is determined by its connections.
They don't connect randomly!

## Divergence and Convergence
- **Divergence**: the stretch of one muscle activates many hundreds of neurons  -> INPUT
- **Convergence**: A single motor cell reciever up to 500 inputs from hundreds of sensory cells -> OUTPUT

## Excitatory and Inhibitory
Neurons can be both **excitatory** (enhances postsynaptic firing) or **inhibitory** (avoid postsynaptic firing).
This is essential to limbs that have protagonist and antagonist muscles: when one is excited, the other must be inhibited (e.g. in the arm, biceps and triceps are antagonists).

- Feed-forward inhibition: excites an inhibitory neuron that connects to other neurons -> useful for regulating antagonistic muscles behavior.
- Feed-back inhibition: excites an inhibitory neuron which inhibits the neuron itself -> useful for regulating the stimulated pathway, to prevent from exceeding critical levels of excitation.
# Plasticity
Neural connections can be modified through experience and learning (especially chemical synapses are more able to change since they don't need to be in direct touch).
- **Short term** changes lasts seconds/hours -> increase or decrease effectiveness of existing established connections
- **Long term** changes are structural changes lasting days.
The phantom limb phenomenon is a proof of the importance of plasticity: motor parts connected to missing limbs in paraplegic volunteers still expects sensory inputs coming from them. With time, the neurons connect to nearby areas related to other part of the body, resulting in weird illusory sensations.

# Information Transfer
Depending on the type of [[Neurons#Synapses]], the type of communication is different:
- **ELECTRICAL** -> pre and post synapses must physically touch. The two neurons are **isopotential** -> electrical changes are instantaneously reflected between the two neurons.
It's useful for fast transfer and to syncronize cells. Present for reflex pathways or in synchronized ones.

- **CHEMICAL** -> presence of synaptic cleft (gap) between pre and post synapses.
	- Neurotransmitters are chemical substances
	- Presynaptic terminal: contains vesicles
	- Synaptic vesicles: are filled with molecules of neurotransmitters (released during [[Action Potential]]s).
	- When neuroreceptors bind to tranmitter, make the Na+ channels to open, causing Na+ cells to flow inside and thus depolarizing the cell, with the possibility of triggering an [[Action Potential]].
	It's slower but much more plastic, and can modulate signals.
