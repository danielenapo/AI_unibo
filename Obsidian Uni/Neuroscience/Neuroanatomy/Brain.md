_It's the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of our body._

It's divided in two **hemispheres** (left sa right), but one controls the opposite half of the body (i.e. left hemisphere controls right part of the body and viceversa), through the **pyramidal decussation** that happens in the [[Central Nervous System#Spinal cord]].

# Anatomy
![[Pasted image 20230409211723.png]]
1. **Brain stem (tronco encefalico)** -> basic life functions 
2. **Cerebellum (cervelletto)**-> regulates motor functions: posture, movement coordination, balance.
3. **Diencephalon**, divided into
	1. **Thalamus** ->gateway to celebral cortex, mediates and links sensory information from [[Peripheral Nervous System]] to the cortex.
	2. **Hypothalamus** -> regulates temperature, hunger, cardiac rhythm, motivation.
# Cerebral hemisphere 
![[Pasted image 20230612160111.png]]
Largest part of the brain. Consists of
1. white matter (axons + [[Glial cells]])
2. **Basal ganglia** -> motor control, **reinforcement learning** (many **[[Dopamine neurons]] and receptors**)
3. **Amygdala** ->**memory**, [[Learning]], attention, decision making 
5. **Hippocampus** -> memory formation, spatial memory

6. **Cerebral cortex** (gray matter made of [[Neurons]]' Soma) -> "corpus callosum" with many layers of neurons. Divided into 4 lobes, distinguished by pronounced sulci. Each one has specialized functional roles in neural processing ("cytoarchitectonics")
	1. **Frontal lobe**
		1. Motor cortex -> planning of movements
		2. Prefrontal cortex -> long term planning, decision making, value
	2. **Parietal lobe** -> receives sensory information from inside and outside, and integrates it
	3. **Occipital lobe** -> visual cortex
	4. **Temporal lobe** -> auditory cortex (sound processing)
	**association cortex** -> section that integrates inputs from multiple cortex areas, to produce integrated experience of the world (high level abilities: language, abstract thinking)
