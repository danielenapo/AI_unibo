_Delivers sensory information to CNS, and carries motor commands from CNS to muscles and glands._

Divided into **Somatic** and **Autonomic** nervous systems

# Somatic nervous system
Sensory neurons that receive information from skin/muscles, and motor controls for muscles.

# Autonomic nervous system
![[Pasted image 20230409192028.png]]
Regulates **involuntary processes**: mediates visceral sensations (internal organs), and motor controls for the vascular system, viscera and glands. 
Divided into **three subsystems:**

### Sympathetic system
**Fight or flight response**: stimulates adrena glands to prepare for immediate action (e.g increase heart rate, dilate pupils, ...)
### Parasympathetic system
**Antagonistic** to the [[#Sympathetic system]], aims to **maintain the body** (e.g. slow heart rate, stimulate digestion, stimulate bladder, ...)
### Enteric system
Governs gastrointestinestal tract (semi-automatic).
