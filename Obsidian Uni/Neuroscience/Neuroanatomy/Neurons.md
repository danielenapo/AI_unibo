We have more than **100 billion** neurons in our system, each of them with thousands of connections.

## Cell Body or Soma
![[Pasted image 20230408160811.png]]
- **Cell membrane**: membrane that separates the intracellular and extracellular space 
- **Cytoplasm**: intracellular fluid that is made up of a combination of ions
- **Extracellular fluid:** made up of a mixture of the same types of ions found in the intracellular fluid 
- **Nucleus**: contains the genes of the cell (DNA), and the endoplasmic reticulum, where proteins are synthesized. 
- ==Axon Hillox==: sums input signals. Responsible for starting an action potential.
## Dendrites
- Recieve the input from other nerve cells:
- have **neurotransmitter receptors** that bind to neurotransmitters released by upstream neurons at the **synapses**
## Axon 
- Carries signal to other neurons → [[Action Potential]]
- Covered by myelin sheets ([[Glial cells#Macroglia]], shwan cells)
## Synapses 
- End part of the Axon
- Spatially close to the postsynaptic perceptors of other neurons
- Physically transmits signal to other neurons with **neurotransmitter**:
	- **ELECTRICAL**  -> needs direct contact, but very fast.
	- **CHEMICAL** -> Emits biochemical substances. Can be further away, but slower.
Between a presynaptic and postsynaptic receptor, there is a small gap called **Synaptic cleft**
### Types of synaptic connections
![[Pasted image 20230408174427.png]]
- Axodentritic -> directly connected to dentrites (most efficient communication)
- Axoaxonic -> connected to axon
- Axosomatic -> connected to the soma (body cell)

# Functional distinction
Neurons are also classificated depending on their functionality. This is beacuse funcionality also defines the physiology (structure) of the neuron
![[Pasted image 20230408174753.png]]
- **Sensory Neurons** -> Carry information from pheripheral sensors to nervous system
- **Motor Neurons** -> Carry commands from central nerv. sys. to muscles and glands
- **Interneurons** -> Mediate and modulates impulses between the two previous classes
