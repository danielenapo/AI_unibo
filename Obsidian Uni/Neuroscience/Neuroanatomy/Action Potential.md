_**a sudden, fast, transitory, and propagating change of the resting membrane potential** of a neuron. It's **the way that neurons and muscle cells communicate** with each other or with other cells._
It's given by a fast, relevant ==change in the electrical state of the neuron==, by opening and closing Ion Channels.
## Resting membrane potential
![[Pasted image 20230408180748.png]]
The cellular membrane ensures that there is a ==**-70 mV** electric potential== between the inside and outside of the cell (namely, the Cytoplasm and extracellular fluids).
This is the **resting state**, which is maintained by **2 mechanisms**:

## **Na+/K+ pumps**
- **uses energy** to transport ions through the membrane (requires ATP)
- Transport Na+ outside and K+ inside (more Na+ though)-> concentration gradient (imbalance)

## **Ion channels**
- Allow Ions to flow passively (**no energy** required) according to the natural concentration gradient imbalance provided by the Na+/K+ pumps
- Creates **electrical gradient**, as when K+ exits, leaves behind a negative charge

Eventually, the force of the concentration gradient pushing K+ out is the same as the electrical gradient bringing K+ in -> ==**electrochemical equilibrium of -70mV**==, which can be exploited for signaling.
- The resting membrane potential can be quickly and radically changed

1. **DEPOLARIZATION**: 
	When the summed signals of the postsynaptic receptors (both excitatory and inhibitory) at one time depolarize enough the Axon Hilloc (**threshold is ==-50 mV==**), Na+ channels are opened: positive charges Na+ get in, neutralizing negative charges, depolarizing the cell. This makes other channels to open too, in a positive-feedback loop.
2. **OVERSHOOT**: 
	The membrane potential reaches equilibrium at a **peak of ==+30 mV==**, and then starts to decline due to the closing of sodium channels and the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels: let K+ out, thus reducing positive charges inside, repolarizing the cell.
3. **REPOLARIZATION**: 
	The membrane potential rapidly becomes more negative due to the efflux of potassium ions out of the cell.
4. **HYPERPOLARIZATION** -> _**Refractory period**_: 
	The membrane potential briefly becomes more negative than the resting value (under -80 mV) due to the continued efflux of potassium ions until the potassium channels close.
	During this **refractory period**, no more action potentials can be triggered:
	- **Limits number of action potentials** in a given time window
	- Impose **unidirectional current flow**.
5. **MEMBRANE REST POTENTIAL**:
	When the flow of K+ going outside the cell through ion pumps and the K+ coming inside through Na/K+ pumps is the same, an elettrochemical equilibrium is reached, and the voltage inside the cell is -70mV.

## Nodes of Ranvier
In myelinated neurons, Na+ voltage-gated channels are located in the gaps between [[Glial cells]]. These "Nodes of Ranvier" act as signal amplifiers.

## All-or-none behavior
All action potentials have the same amplitude, in every kind of neuron.
This means that **strength of signal** is not given by amplitude, but by **frequency**.

The amount of neurotransmitters emitted increase with frequency.
