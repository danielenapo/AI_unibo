_[[Neurons]] that release **dopamine** neurotransmitters, which gives prediction error rewards, and are responsible for [[Learning#Associative]]_
![[Pasted image 20230412135307.png]]

Dopamine neurons change their firing rate when [[Surprise#Prediction error]]s do not meed reality:
- Increase rate when error is positive
- Decrease rate when error is negative
# Dopamine
Dopamine is a **neuromodulator**: a neurotransmitter having effects other than (or in addition to) direct neural excitation or inhibition. 
## Dopaminergetic pathways
1. **Nigrostriatal pathway** -> originates in substantia nigra, critical for movement
2. **Mesolimbic pathway** -> originates in Ventral tegmental area (VTA)
3. **Mesocortical pathway** -> originates in VTA and extends in the cortex
The last 2 are essential for reinforcement learning.
