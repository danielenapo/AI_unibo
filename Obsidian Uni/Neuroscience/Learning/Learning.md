_Enduring change in response or behavior that occurs as a result of experience._

# Non associative
Learning about properties of a **single stimulus**.
## Habituation
**Decrease** in innate response to a stimulus repeatedly presented -> **innocuous**
e.g. we're scared of fireworks at first for the loud noises, then we like them
## Sensitization
**Increase** in innate response to a stimulus repeatedly presented -> **harmful**
e.g. stop rubbing when feeling itch, since we know it may cause injuries

# Associative
Learning about associations between **multiple** stimulus or actions
## Classical conditioning
_aka [[Pavlovian conditioning]]_.
Learning about association of at least **two stimuli**:
- A neutral **conditioned stimulus**
- An innated **unconditioned stimulus**, used as a reinforces 
	- **primary reinforcer** -> biologically prepared to elicit a response (sex, food or pain)
	- **secondary reinforcer** -> a stimulus that has previously become relevant from associative learning. (e.g. money for humans)
The learner learns to predict events in order to maximize rewarding outcomes, and minimize aversive outcomes.

## Operant conditioning
_aka [[Instrumental Conditioning]]_.
Learning about association between and action (behavior) and an outcome
