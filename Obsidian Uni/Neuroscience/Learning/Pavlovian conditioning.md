_Classical form of [[Learning#Associative]] that aims to learn a response for a conditioned stimulus, starting from an unconditioned one._ 

-   The **conditioned stimulus (CS)** is the neutral stimulus that is paired with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated pairings, the CS alone can elicit a conditioned response that is similar to the unconditioned response (e.g. sound)
-   The **unconditioned stimulus (US)** is the **biologically** potent physiological stimulus that naturally triggers an unconditioned response without any prior learning (e.g food)
-   The **unconditioned response (UR)** is the reflexive response that is elicited by the unconditioned stimulus without any prior learning
-   The **conditioned response (CR)** is the learned response that is elicited by the conditioned stimulus after repeated pairings with the unconditioned stimulus

The role of CS and US in classical conditioning is to establish a **contingency** between them, such that the ==CS becomes a signal or **predictor** of the US==, and thus modifies the behavior of the subject animal.

# Phases
-   **Acquisition** is the first stage of learning, when a response is established. This happens after ==repeated pairings of the CS and the unconditioned stimulus== (US), which naturally triggers the unconditioned response (UR). The strength of the CR increases up to a certain point before it levels off
-   **Extinction** is the process of weakening and eliminating the CR. It occurs when the ==CS is repeatedly presented without the US==, leading to a decrease in the CR. Extinction does not erase the original learning, but rather creates a new association between the CS and the absence of the US. ==EXTIONTION IS NOT FORGETTING!==, it's a form of learning.
-   **Reconsolidation** is the process of reactivating and updating a previously consolidated memory. It occurs when a reminder of the CS triggers a reactivation of the original CS-US association, which can then be modified by new learning. Reconsolidation can lead to strengthening or weakening of the CR, depending on whether the US is present or absent during reactivation. (it's much faster than acquisition, because the association was already there)

## Timing
**Timing** refers to the temporal relationship between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). It affects the acquisition and expression of the conditioned response (CR).

- **forward conditioning**: by anticipating the CS to the US, a cause-effect relationship is established
	- In **delay conditioning**, the CS is presented before and overlaps with the US. This is the simplest and most effective type of conditioning.
	- In **trace conditioning**, the CS is presented before and ends before the US, leaving a gap or trace interval between them. .
- In **simultaneous conditioning**, the CS and US are presented at the same time. This is a less effective type of conditioning, as it does not allow a prediction of the US by the CS. 
- In **backward conditioning**, the CS is presented after the US. This is a very weak or ineffective type of conditioning, as it does not allow a prediction of the US by the CS.

The longer the trace time, the slower (and less effective) the learning.
## Amygdala and Hippocampus

![[Pasted image 20230529110527.png]]
-   The **amygdala** is a [[Brain]] region that processes fear and aversive learning.
-   LaBar et al. (1995) used a fear conditioning paradigm with a light (CS) and a noise (US) and measured the skin conductance response (SCR) as a fear index (CR).
-   They showed that amygdala-damaged patients did not learn the fear, but could report the association. 
- Hippocampus-damaged patients learned the fear, but could not report the association. A patient with damage to both regions did not learn or report the association.
-   This showed a **double dissociation** of conditioning and declarative knowledge by the amygdala and hippocampus. It also suggested that different brain systems are involved in emotional learning and memory.
