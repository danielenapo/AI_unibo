## Map vs response strategy
A rat solving a maze can learn its path in 2 ways:
- By learning a cognitive map of the enviroment and the location of the reward -> simple training
- By learning by heart the sequence of turns that he has to make to reach the reward (forward+left+forward)  -> intensive training (overfitting basically)

If the initial position of the rat changes, in the first case he's able to notice the difference and reach the reward anyway, in the second he turns in the wrong direction

## Tolman's maze experiment
A special maze was built with doors and curtains that make the maze difficult to master for rats

Three groups of rats were observed
- Group 1 recieved **no rewards** for solving
- Group 2 recieved **rewards** for solving
- Group 3 recieved **rewards only after 11 days**
Of course group 2 learned the fastest, but surprisingly group 3 learned much much faster than group 2 when presented with rewards. This suggest that they actually **latently learned** a cognitive map, but in a less efficient way since they had **no motivation**.

==Latent learning confirmed the existance of cognitive maps.==


## Goal directed
- knowledge of relations between knowledge and consequences
- Outcome is motivationally relevant
- Complex tought process
- Very flexible to enviroment changes
- supported by the Dorsomedial Striatum
## Habitual
- Automatic behaviour (because it has been rewarded in the past)
- Simple thought process, requires almos no thinking
- Not flexible to environment changes (learning by heart)
- Supported by Dorsolateral Striatumz
## Testing behaviours
To test if a behaviour is goal directed or habitual:
1. Train -> [[Instrumental Conditioning]]
2. Post-training manipulation -> reinforcer devaluation (make the reward less motivating, for example by giving a lot without reason) -> leads to contingency degradation (extintion)
3. Test session -> repeat the experiment, and check the behaviour
- If the action is performed less, the learning is goal-directed
- If the action is performed in the same way, the learning is habitual
