_AKA **Operant conditioning**. 
[[Learning#Associative]] technique that ==associates between a **behaviour** and an outcome==_

- Actions with **POSITIVE** (satisfaction) outcomes are **MORE probable** to be performed again.
- Actions **NEGATIVE** (discomfort) positive outcomes are **LESS probable** to be performed again.
## Shaping
An existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired _complex_ target behavior by reinforcing exact segments of behavior (==Reinforcement of successive approximations==)

### Delivering Rewards
- **Positive reinforcement**: delivering **reward** increases probability of emitting actions.
- **Negative reinforcement**: omitting reward increases probability of emitting action.
### Delivering Outcomes
- **Positive punishment**: delivering aversive **outcome** decreases the probability of emitting the action
- **Negative punishment**: omitting rewarding outcome decreases the probability of emitting the action

## Partial schedules
1. **Fixed ratio** -> outcome is delivered only after a specified number of responses.
2. **Variable ratio** -> outcome is delivered after an unpredictable number of responses.
3. **Fixed interval** -> outcome is delivered after a specified interval of time.
4. **Variable nterval** -> outcome is delivered after an unpredictable  interval of time.

Response varies, but the **variable ratio is the one that keeps more engaged**.
