_AKA **Operant conditioning**. 
[[Learning#Associative]] technique that ==associates between a **behavior** and an outcome.==_
- Actions with **POSITIVE** (satisfaction) outcomes are **MORE probable** to be performed again.
- Actions with **NEGATIVE** (discomfort) outcomes are **LESS probable** to be performed again.

## Shaping
Process of gradually changing responses through successive **trials** towards a desired _complex_ target behavior by reinforcing exact segments of behavior (==Reinforcement of successive approximations==)

### Reinforcement
- **Positive reinforcement**: delivering reward **increases** probability of emitting actions.
- **Negative reinforcement**: omitting punishment **increases** probability of emitting action.
### Punishment
- **Positive punishment**: delivering punishment **decreases** the probability of emitting the action
- **Negative punishment**: omitting reward **decreases** probability of emitting action.

# Frequency
The role of timing and frequency is very important
## Continuous schedule
Desired behavior is presented with outcome every time it is performed.
- fast learning
- fast extinction
## Partial schedules
Desired behavior is followed by outcome only part of the times.
It's slower to learn but less prone to extinction.

1. **Fixed ratio** -> outcome is delivered only after a specified number of responses (e.g. press 3 times a button to get food)
2. **Variable ratio** -> outcome is delivered after an unpredictable number of responses (e.g. press a random times a button to get food, can be 2 to 10)
3. **Fixed interval** -> outcome is delivered after a specified interval of time.
4. **Variable interval** -> outcome is delivered after an unpredictable interval of time.

Response varies, but the **variable ratio is the one that keeps more engaged** (this also explains why gambling is addicting).
