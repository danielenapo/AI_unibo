_In the primate [[Brain]], vision is the dominant sense, which perceives and processes the exterior world._

The human vision system does NOT work like an artificial camera, rather it takes the whole image and only processes certain parts, separating background with foreground with [[Selective attention]] mechanisms.

It is a bidirectional, active, generative process. The brain has certain learned expectations about the world and uses them to make sense of incomplete information (for that reason we sometimes get fooled by our senses)

## Image processing
- **low level**: local contrast, orientation, color, depth, motion
- **intermediate level**: contours, rurface segmentation (distingushing, bud not recognizing, objects), shapes, depth, shading
- **high level:** object recognition
Once a scene has been analyzed, objects will be associated with memories and semantics by other parts of the brain.

# Anatomy
Visual processng is mediated by the retino-geniculo-striate pathwy, which includes
- [[Retina]]
- [[Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)]]
- Primary [[Visual cortex#V1]] , or striate cortex
- [[Extrastriate cortex]] (parietal cortex and ventral pathway)
