Beyond [[Visual cortex#V1]] (Striate Cortex), there is the extrastriate one, which perform high level processing.
It is divided into
- **Ventral pathway** -> object recognition
- **Dorsal pathway** -> guiding movements based on visual information
and also includes V2, V3, V4, V5.

## 3D vision
Perception of depth in humans is based on 
- monocular -> one eye, exploiting cues like shatodws, occlusion, movements
- stereostopic -> requires both eyes, exploiting disparity to compute depth

The first part of the brain to recieve inputs from both eyes is [[Visual cortex#V1]], which can detect:
- Position difference 
- Phase difference
But V5 and the dorsal pathway are essential for disparity calculation.

## Visual motion
contributes to object recognition, depth, and directs attention.
The most of the job is done in the dorsal pathway, in the **Middle Temporal (MT)** region.
It has a column organization, where each column is sensible to preferred movement directions, and **speed**.

### Aperture problem
If a moving contour is seen through a small aperture, only the velocity component perpendicular to the contour can be detected through the opening.
V1 is not able to see it, but V5 solves the problem, since it integrates multiple cells with Receptive fields in different parts of the figure.

# Object Recognition
Our visual experience is based on objects = set of visual features.
Object recognition=assign verbal/semantic label to an object
Happens mainly in V4 and in the ventral pathway.
Requires:
- **Invariance** -> recognizes regardless of rotation and translation
- **Selectivity** -> identificate an object instance among others of the same class
The ventral pathway has smaller receptive fields than the dorsal. It shows greater focalization, essential for object recognition
## Face Recognition
There are neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex that selectively respond to faces. Response changes if elements of faces are mixed or occluded

It's important to notice that the representation of objects occurs not through single neurons, but by populations: there isn't a single grandmother cell, aka **gnostic unit**.
