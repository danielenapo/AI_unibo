_Located inside the eyes, transform visual inputs (light) into neural signals via the **photo transduction process**._

Each retina can be divided into two hemiretinas:
- Nasal hemiretina -> side closest to nose (left of right eye, right of left eye)
- Temporal hemiretina -> side further from the nose (right of the right eye, left of the left eye)

## Partial decussation
Since the temporal hemiretina of one eye also sees the same visual hemifield as the nasal hemiretina of the other, partial decussation ensures that all information of each visual hemifield is processed in the correct side of the brain's visual cortex.
This is similar to what happens with motor and sensory neurons with pyramidal decussation in the [[Central Nervous System#Spinal cord]] (but division is different: there is no mixing of signals).

# Photoreceptors
photoreceptors are bipolar cells that transform light into electrical signals, but they are not neurons. 
In the retina, the highest denity of receptors is in the **fovea** area (high spacial resolution), and it's lower in the peripheral region.

Humans have 2 kinds of receptors:
- ==**Rods**== -> only in peripheral (low res), high light sensitivity (night vision)
- ==**Cones**== -> present only on fovea (high res), low light sensitivity (day vision)
	They're sensible to light frequency (color), so there are **3 types:**
	- S cone -> blue
	- M cone -> green
	- L cone -> red

# Retina Ganglion Cells (RGC)
RGC recieve signals from photoreceptors, and respond with action potentials.
TYPES:
- P (parvo) -> most present, receives from cones, in fovea, small RF
- M (magno) -> less present, receives from rods, in periphery, large RF
- K (kiono) -> least present
![[Pasted image 20230604115825.png]]
RGC have **circular receptive fields**, that can be:
- ON-center -> respond to brightness in the center, and darkness outside
- OFF-center -> respond to darkness in the center, and brightness outside
(antagonistic behavior between center and surrounding area)
![[Pasted image 20230604120009.png]]
The antagonistic behavior allows to ==detect borders== between areas with different contrasts.
## Contrast sensitivity
RGCs work like a gaussian curve, so it responds the most when the frequency of the contrast is aligned with the center.
