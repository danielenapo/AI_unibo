_Located inside the eyes, transform visual inputs (light) into neural signals via the **phototransduction process**._

Each retina can be divided into two hemiretinas:
- Nasal hemiretina -> side closest to nose (left of right eye, right of left eye)
- Temporal hemiretina -> side further from the nose (right of the right eye, left of the left eye)

## Partial decussation
Since the temporal hemiretina of one eye also sees the same visual hemifield as the nasal hemiretina of the other, partial decussation ensures that all information of each visial hemifield is processed in the correct side of the brain's visual cortex.
