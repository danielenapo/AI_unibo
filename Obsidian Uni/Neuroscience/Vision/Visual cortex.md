_Located in the occipital area (back of the brain), responsible of processing visual information in different levels of complexity_

# V1
Also called "Strial cortex".
It is the first to recieve visual input from [[Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)]], and does basic processing.

## Receptive field
Single visual neurons only react to a limited region: **receptive field**.
That neuron responds only when the stimulus is presented in its field.

The response is strongest when is presented in the middle of the RF, and gets weaker further along: it can be described by a 2D Gaussian.
The higher the processing level, the bigger the receptive fields get for single neurons (like in CNNs).

## Simple and Complex cells
- **Simple cells** add together the signals of many [[Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)]] cells, so that its receptive field becomes prolungated (not circularly simmetric), so that it can be ==sensible to orientation==.

- **Complex cells**, in a similar way add together many simple cells. It ==responds to both orientation and movement==.

## Ice cube model
In V1, neurons with similar functional properties are close together.
1) **Cortical columns** -> neurons in same column share the same preferred orientation (i.e. vertical)
2) **Ocular dominance columns** -> groups of neurons that responds stronger to stimuli from one of the two eyes
3) **Blob and interblob** -> blob groups of neuron sensible to certain colors of the stimulus

# V2
V2 is similar to V1, but also responds to **illusory contours**

## Illusory contours
Cells in V1 are unable to perceive illusory contours, which are detected in V2
