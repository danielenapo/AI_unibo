_Located in the occipital area (back of the brain), responsible of processing visual information in different levels of complexity_

# V1
Also called "Strial cortex".
It is the first to recieve visual input from [[Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)]], and does basic processing.

## Receptive field
Single visual neurons only react to a limited region: **receptive field**.
That neuron responds only when the stimulus is presented in its field.

The response is strongest when is presented in the middle of the RF, and gets weaker further along: it can be described by a 2D Gaussian.
The higher the processing level, the bigger the receptive fields get for single neurons (like in CNNs).
