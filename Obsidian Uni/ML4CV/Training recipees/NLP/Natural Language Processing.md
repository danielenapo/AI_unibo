_Automating the analysis, generation, and acquisition of human (“natural”) language_
- **Analysis**: input is language, output is some representation that supports useful action
- **Generation**: input is that representation, output is language
- **Acquisition**: obtaining the representation and necessary algorithms, from knowledge and data

NLP is inherently a hard task for computers, since input is noisy, natural language is **ambiguous**, and a linguistic representation is something abstract, not representable (like the embeddings).

# Linguistics
NLP is based on Linguistic, a discipline as old as language itself, that scientifically studies all aspect of natural language.
## Morphology
_Analysis of words into meaningful components._
Parts of words contribute to the meaning of the whole word.
Those atomic parts are called "_lexeme_". 
There are also words composed of more words (e.g. phrasal verbs, like "make up").

## Syntax
_Transform a sequence of symbols into a hierarchical or compositional structure._
Closely related to linguistic theories about what makes some sentences well-formed and others not (basically the grammar and rules of the language).

There are many ways in which a sentence could be analyzed (ambiguity).

## Semantics
_Mapping of natural language sentences into domain representations._
Going beyond specific domains is a goal of AI
