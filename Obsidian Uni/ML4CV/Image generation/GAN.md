*Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014.*
*It's a generative model that trains two adversarial models*
- ***Generator**: the final image generator that generates synthetic images. Its goal is to fool the discriminator*
- ***Discriminator**: image classificator that aims to distinguish between synthetic and real images.*
