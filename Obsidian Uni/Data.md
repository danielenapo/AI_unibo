We use data to undestand something about reality.
How well does that data rapresent reality? (QUALITY)
Better data quality means better results

# Data Types
![[Pasted image 20230116213527.png]]
## Domains
- discrete
- continuous
# Characteristics
- Dimensionality
- Sparcity -> many zeros or null values
- "nulls in disguise" -> null values labeled as 0
- Resolution -> too much: noise. too little: doesen't show patterns
- Tables (ex relational)
- Data matrix
- Transactions
# Quality
- **Noise:** modification of original data (due to errors in retrieving it, small fluctuations)
- **Outliers:** data whose characteristic is much different from most of the other datapoints

- **missing values:** when that data was not collected, or not applicable for a feature. Can be dealt in different ways (ignore, estimate, ...)
- **duplicates:** issue when merging data from different sources, have to be cleaned.
- **balanced**: in [[Classification]], some classes can be less represented than others. Ideally, all classes should be equally present in the dataset.
