**CLASSIFICATION**= guessing labels from a lot of examples (DISCRETE values)
**CLUSTERING GROUPS** -> find hidden groups on the basis of similarities
**REGRESSION** (value extimaton) -> related to classification, but with different models (predicts CONTINUOUS values)

SIMILARITY MATCHING

**[[Supervised Learning]] VS [[Unsupervised Learning]] :**
Depends on the problem (and/or the data) to solve -> it isn't a design choice
