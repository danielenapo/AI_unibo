It's very useful to apply before a [[Computer Vision]] algorithm, as a pre-processing step (simplifies analysis), moreover for all data analysis applications it's valid the say "_Garbage in, garbage out_", which applies also to computer vision.
Image processing allows to get the most out of the input data.
In [[Deep Learning computer vision]]es, this process can also include data augmentation

This operation includes:
- functioning of the [[Pinhole Camera model]]
- techniques to deal with [[Image Noise]] through [[Image Filters]]
- Perform [[Edge Detection]]
