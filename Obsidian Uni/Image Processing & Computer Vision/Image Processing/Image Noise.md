Images will have noise for different reasons. It is more noticeable on plain regions.
It can be seen as a random variable (normal distribution with zero mean):

# Denoising techniques
## Denoising over time
We can take multiple images of the same scene (assuming it's static), and make an average of the picels. With a sufficient high number of images, the mean of the noise will be approximately zero (by definition).

## Denoising over space
Using multiple images is impractical (scenes are not static, will cause motion blur):
we can take the mean over a neighborhood square of KxK pixels.

Bigger K means better smoothing (noise reduction), but also leads to blurry images (the window would be on the edge of an object, blending with the background)
# Noise sources
- **Photon Shot Noise –** The time between photon arrivals at a pixel is governed by a Poisson statistics and thus the number of photons collected during exposure time is not constant. 
- **Electronic Circuitry Noise –** It is generated by the electronics which reads-out the charge and amplifies the resulting voltage signal. 
- **Quantization Noise –** related to the final ADC conversion (in digital cameras). 
- **Dark Current Noise –** a random amount of charge due to thermal excitement is observed at each pixel even though the sensor is not exposed to light.

Based on the source, the final effect can be one of these:
## Impulse Noise
Many dots distributed randomly (poisson, discrete)
## Gaussian Noise
Noise is a normal distribution
